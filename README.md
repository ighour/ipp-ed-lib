# Project Library

Project for [IPP/ESTG](https://www.estg.ipp.pt) course "Estruturas de Dados" (Data Structures)

## Repositories

### **[Library](https://github.com/ighour/ipp-ed-lib)** - Own library of abstract data types. *(here)*
### **[Project](https://github.com/ighour/ipp-ed)** - Project made using the library to construct a social network.

## Objectives

* This repository contains abstract data types to be used in the project.

## Abstract Data Types

* **DynamicArray** and **DynamicArrayCircular**: to easily manage arrays with automatic redimension when needed.

* **List**: the base of lists using arrays (for ordered and unordered).

* **Ordered List**: an ordered list of elements.

* **Unordered List**: an unordered list of elements.

* **BaseGraph**: the base of graphs and networks, with common attributes and methods.

* **Network**: a common network (graph with weights).

* **Stack**: a simple stack.

* **Queue**: a simple queue, with no priority.

* **Binary Tree**: a binary tree.

* **Min Heap**: a minheap.

* **Priority Min Queue**: a priority minimum queue.

## Built With

* [Java](https://www.java.com/)
* [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/)
