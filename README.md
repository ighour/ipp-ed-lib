### **[Project](https://gitlab.com/ighour-learn/ipp/ed/project)** - Project made using the library to construct a social network.

*Detailed info about components is in their own repository.*

## Objectives

* The main purpose is to construct a social network which will receive an input with users data (json file), construct a network with them and enable it's management.

* This repository contains abstract data types to use in project.

## Abstract Data Types Used in Project

Some of the used abstract data types includes the following:

* **DynamicArray** and **DynamicArrayCircular**: to easily manage arrays with automatic redimension when needed.

* **List**: the base of lists using arrays (for ordered and unordered).

* **Ordered List**: an ordered list of elements.

* **Unordered List**: an unordered list of elements.

* **BaseGraph**: the base of graphs and networks, with common attributes and methods.

* **Network**: a common network (graph with weights).

* **Stack**: a simple stack.

* **Queue**: a simple queue, with no priority.

* **Binary Tree**: a binary tree.

* **Min Heap**: a minheap.

* **Priority Min Queue**: a priority minimum queue.
